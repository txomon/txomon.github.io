    <div class="blog-post-content">
        <p>I&rsquo;m taking this time to clean up the stuff I have, and I have decided to put in a bit better shape my blog.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite a bit tired of jekyll, the part of using ruby never convinced me, and documentation sucked, so I decided to move to Hugo.</p>
<p>Just in case you are wondering why documentation sucked, it&rsquo;s because content is all mixed, pro tip:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4vKPhjcMZg" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Anyway, the process has been kind-a terrible, because hugo&rsquo;s docs are,&hellip; well, they hold more information but they are also completely mixed, getting started has a full reference of the documentation, it doesn&rsquo;t hold you by the hand on how to build a site&hellip; There are tons of things that I have been looking at examples just to be able to pinpoint them.</p>
<p>Few things that I need to remember for the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New posts can be created with for example: <code>hugo new post/2020/03/21/from-jekyll-to-hugo.md</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When creating posts with images, because output will be a folder, they need to already be a folder by themselves: <code>hugo new post/2020/03/21/from-jekyll-to-hugo/index.md</code> for this one for example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all themes support everything. Hugo seems like it has been extended in several ways through themes that do crazy stuff</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I am trying to create a pre-commit hook to update the website whenever needed</p>
