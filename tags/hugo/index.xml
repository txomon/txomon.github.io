      <description>I have created https://github.com/txomon/pre-commit-hooks as a generic way to have random code be specified directly in my git repos without having to create custom hooks. The inner working are basics, and you can actually check them there.
pre-commit relies on you adding a hooks repository and the hook id within it, which will be then linked to whatever scripts you have set in that hooks repository.
My solution is to create a generic hook that uses system kind of hook, and just run bash -c with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m taking this time to clean up the stuff I have, and I have decided to put in a bit better shape my blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m quite a bit tired of jekyll, the part of using ruby never convinced me, and documentation sucked, so I decided to move to Hugo.
Just in case you are wondering why documentation sucked, it&amp;rsquo;s because content is all mixed, pro tip:
  Anyway, the process has been kind-a terrible, because hugo&amp;rsquo;s docs are,&amp;hellip; well, they hold more information but they are also completely mixed, getting started has a full reference of the documentation, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold you by the hand on how to build a site&amp;hellip; There are tons of things that I have been looking at examples just to be able to pinpoint them.</description>
