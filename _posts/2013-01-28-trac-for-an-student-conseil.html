<p>As you maybe know, I am part of the student's counsel of my faculty. Due to that, I have many times be thinking on upgrading the UE (User Experience) of the people that comes to us.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they come to our local at the ETSIB and ask their questions, if in that moment there isn't the person assigned to their problem, we write their question in a question notebook, and the person will answer them with the provided data.</p>
<p>Here there are different problems:<br />
1. People that comes have to wait for the assignee to contact them, just because writting all the problem with needed data is not possible.<br />
2. Each person with a assignation has to search into the book looking for</p>
