        <p>As you maybe know, I am part of the student&rsquo;s council of my faculty. Due to that, I have many times be thinking on upgrading the UE (User Experience) of the people that comes to us.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they come to our local at the ETSIB and ask their questions, if in that moment there isn&rsquo;t the person assigned to their problem, we write their question in a question notebook, and the person will answer them with the provided data.</p>
